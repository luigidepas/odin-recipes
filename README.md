# odin-recipes
My first TOP (The Odin Project) project!
This project is based on a simple website where you can find various recipes, as required by the TOP curriculum. You can find 3 different recipes for 3 italian dishes.

Some recipe information may be incorrect and results may vary. 
It is recommended to follow recipes on other websites, curated by professionals.
