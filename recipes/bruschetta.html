            <li>First of all, wash the ripe tomatoes and cut them into tiny cubes. After that, put them in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Then, place the slice(s) of bread in an oven or on a grill. If you choose the oven, preheat it to 180-200Â°C. Make sure all the sides of the bread slices are crispy.</li>
            <li>While the bread is being prepared, mix the tomato cubes, salt, basil leaves, black pepper and extra virgin olive oil in the bowl you took before. (Alternatively you can add the seasoning, ingredient by ingredient, without mixing when the bread is ready)</li>
            <li>When the bread is ready, place the mixture you have prepared on top of the bread slices. If you want, you can add more oil.</li>
