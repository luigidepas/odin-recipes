            <li>300ml of water</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare a large bowl and mix the flour with the salt.</li>
            <li>Prepare a small bowl of yeast with warm water, and wait for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix the flour with the yeast. While doing so, slowly add a cup of water.</li>
            <li>Place the dough on a stable surface and knead for 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take the kneaded dough and place it in a bowl, and then cover it with a cloth. Let the dough rise for an hour.</li>
            <li>While you're waiting for the dough, preheat your oven to 250Â°C.</li>
            <li>When the wait time for the dough is over, take it and make a round disc shape.</li>
            <li>Add the toppings: spread the tomato sauce all over the dough, but make sure to leave some space around the edge for the crust.</li>
            <li>Next, place the mozzarella on top of the tomato sauce, and add the desired amount of oil on the toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza in the oven, until the crust becomes golden and the cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>After baking the pizza, add some basil on the top. Now, your pizza is ready!</li>
