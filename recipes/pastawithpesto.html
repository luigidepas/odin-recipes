        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A pack of pasta (trenette or linguine is better)</li>
            <li>50/100g of fresh basil</li>
            <li>A pinch of coarse salt</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>20g of pine nuts</li>
            <li>Some extravirgin olive oil</li>
            <li>40g of grated Parmiggiano Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>40g of grated pecorino cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, let's make the pesto sauce. Wash and dry the basil.</li>
            <li>Peel and chop the garlic. After that, place the garlic inside a traditional mortar and grind. Then, place the basil leaves with a pinch of coarse salt and continue grinding.</li>
            <li>Crush the basil against the walls of the mortar by rolling the pestle in a rotary motion and rotating the mortar in the opposite direction.</li>
            <li>After the basil starts to form a green liquid like a uniform cream, add the pine nuts and the grated cheese and continue moving the pestle in order to make a creamier sauce.</li>
            <li>Finally, gradually add the extra virgin olive oil, repeating the same movement until you reach the desired consistency. Usually pesto should appear as a thick, light green cream.</li>
            <li>Start preparing the pasta according to the package instruction until al dente. When the pasta is ready, you can keep a little amount of pasta cooking water to pour in the pesto in order to change its consistency (it should not be too liquid!).</li>
            <li>Mix the pasta with the pesto sauce in pan (it's best to use the same pan that you used to cook the pasta).</li>
            <li>Now, you can serve your pasta with pesto, according to the desidered portions. Here's a tip: you can add a leaf of basil on top to have a delicious look!</li>
